Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers
integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several
times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build
and automated tests. While automated testing is not strictly part of CI
it is typically implied.

One of the key benefits of integrating regularly is that you can detect
errors quickly and locate them more easily. As each change introduced is
typically small, pinpointing the specific change that introduced a
defect can be done quickly.

In recent years CI has become a best practice for software development
and is guided by a set of key principles. Among them are revision
control, build automation and automated testing.
