Continuous Delivery is the practice of keeping your codebase deployable
at any point. Beyond making sure your application passes automated tests
it has to have all the configuration necessary to push it into
production. Many teams then do push changes that pass the automated
tests into a test or production environment immediately to ensure a fast
development loop.

As we pointed out before, Continuous Deployment is closely related to
Continuous Integration and refers to keeping your application deployable
at any point or even automatically releasing into production if the
latest version passes all automated tests.

If you wish to release your product really fast, you should automate
your entire workflow, not just the testing. Having a well designed and
smoothly running Continuous Deployment (CD) solution will be the glue
between the tools you use, especially between the SCM (Source Control
Management) provider/server and the hosting environment you are using.
This will also help you to onboard new people and grow your team as they
can rely on a fully automated process from day one.
